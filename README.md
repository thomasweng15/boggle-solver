Boggle Solver
=============
C program to find all the words in an n by n grid of letters
(where n is between 0 and 10), as seen in boggle puzzles.

After inputting the grid of letters, the program returns a list of words that are valid for the board, which I then input into the game.

Usage
---
1. `$ ./boggle -s SIZE`, where `SIZE` is the length and width of the square boggle grid
2. Type in each row of the grid with a new line after each complete row
3. press Ctrl+D to get output (this is clunky but signals EOF of input)

Demo
---
I tested the program on grids generated on [http://weboggle.info](http://weboggle.info).
